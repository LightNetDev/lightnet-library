# LightNet

Share the message of Jesus and strengthen believers worldwide. LightNet empowers you to create digital media libraries, making your content accessible on the web — including videos, audio, images, and books.

LightNet is built as an integration for the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework, enabling the creation of statically generated sites that can be hosted on any file server. These sites are fast, easily extendable, and fully support internationalization.
